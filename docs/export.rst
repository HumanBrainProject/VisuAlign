**Export of flat files for the QUINT workflow**
 --------------------------------------------------

There is an “Export” function for generating .flat files for Nutil (.png-s are created too).
A message will appear when the export is completed.

The export also generates a “report.tsv” file that can be opened in Excel.
This shows how many pixels have been affected in the non-linear process.
The stable % number gives you an average of how far the QuickNII output was from the non-linear correction,
considering the non-linear correction to be the best situation (100%).
