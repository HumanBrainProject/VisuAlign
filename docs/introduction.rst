**Introduction**
------------------- 
VisuAlign is one of several tools developed by the Human Brain Project
(HBP) with the aim of facilitating brain atlas based analysis and
integration of experimental data and knowledge about the human and
rodent brain. VisuAlign is a tool for applying user-guided nonlinear refinements (inplane) to an existing,
affine 2D-to-3D registration, such as created using QuickNII (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/quicknii/).
While linear registration tools are vital in bringing experimental image data to standardized coordinate spaces,
for precise quantitative analysis one has to address the residual anatomical variability among test subjects after registration.
VisuAlign is a tool designed for this task. (https://ebrains.eu/service/quicknii-and-visualign).
