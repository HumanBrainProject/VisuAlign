 
 **2. Navigating between sections**
 ------------------------------------
Navigating between slices happens in the top-right corner, jump to first section (|<<), jump 10 sections towards the
start (<10<), and the same towards the end. Keyboard shortcuts for navigation are the Left/Right arrows, moving one section back/forth.
