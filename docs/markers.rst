- New markers are added under the mouse cursor by pressing the Space bar                                   
- Nonlinear distortions are applied by dragging a marker using the mouse                                                  
- Press Delete or Backspace to remove a marker under the mouse cursor                                     
- A good strategy is to place markers around the contour of the section first, and then proceed with refining the inner parts.
- Markers can and should be used to pin/surround locations that should not be affected by further modifications.       
- The default marker color is black, but it can be changed using the first color picker (near to the top-left corner of the application window)                                    
- Try to keep the number of markers to a minimum.          
- The markers are saved automatically, allowing you to go back to previous section images.
